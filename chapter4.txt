The ancient ones hated the gods above. From the Good Moradin and the Evil Lolth and all in between these opposing deities, a hatred was present in hearts and near all of them.
	But, a small few had taken it upon themselves to instead actively seek out guidance from the deities of these ancient primal times in the universe. Through the
trials of the apocalypse they ascended from mortal to demi-god upon achieving their divine shard. Using the power now bestowed upon them by the representation of Neutrality
within the world, the four horsemen committed the first crusade to be weaved into the eons of history.
	However, not all the ancient ones were accounted for at the end of the slaughter. Though these few wielded power to rival gods themselves, hundreds of the ancient
ones are still out there within their legacy of wrath, brewed from the betrayal of their own.
