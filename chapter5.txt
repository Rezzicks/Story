Dalem Forezand scoures the Dunes of the Infernals, a mass of desert and death as far as the eye can see. He started his journey to map these accursed dunes from
the border of the Harsept Mountain region; his homeland. After weeks, he has finally encountered new lands of greenery, large forests of oak and birchwood, clean water lakes
and rivers, life a plenty in this new region.
